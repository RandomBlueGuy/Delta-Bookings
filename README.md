# **What is Delta Bookings?**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delta Bookings is the project we decided to take as part of our
study plan at Make It Real. It is a fully fledged website we
developed from the ground up, be it design, front-end and back-end
functionality, we made it. Of course, it was only possible due to
the help of our mentors at Make It real, as well as some extra help
we got along the way.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, to answer the question, what is “Delta Bookings”? It is an
application designed to allow the user to search and book hotel
reservations all around the world. All the results are filtered by
city and preferred date.
